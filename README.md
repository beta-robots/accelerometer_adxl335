### Overview
This repository holds an Arduino library to read data from a [ADXL335](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/SMD/adxl335.pdf) accelerometer.

### Download
In case the Arduino libraries folder didn't exist, create it within your Arduino sketch book:
```shell
$ mkdir [somewhere]/your-sketch-book/libraries
```

Move to your Arduino libraries folder:
```shell
$ cd [somewhere]/your-sketch-book/libraries
```

Finally download the library code:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/beta-robots/accelerometer_adxl335.git
```

### How To Use It
Take a look at the examples/adxl335_reading.ino file to play with the accelerometer or to get inspiration for your 
developments.
